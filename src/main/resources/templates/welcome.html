            <h2> Rules of the Game </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Each game will generate a random word to be guessed. </li>
                <li> You have up to 7 incorrect guesses to make. </li>
                <li> The game ends either when you have guessed the word completely (meaning you win the game) or make more than 7 incorrect guesses (meaning you lose the game). </li>
                <li> Each time you go back to the welcome page and start a game, a new game with a new random word will be shown. </li>
                <li> You can also go back to any game by going to localhost:8080/game/id, where id is the game id. </li>
