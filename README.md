# Online-Hangman
I developed this game using Spring Boot frammework, Java and IntelliJ. The player will need to guess a word which is randomly picked by the system.

## Rules of the game
1. The player can make up to 7 incorect guesses.
2. The player can choose to go back to a previous game whether it is completed or not. If the game is completed, then the player is redirected to the game over page. Otherwise, the player is redirected to the game state he was previously with all the correct letters guesses shown as well.
3. The player can play as many games as he wants without the need to finish any one of them.
